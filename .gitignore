# .gitignore file for The Nucleus Stack

# IntelliJ IDE settings directory. You almost never want your IDE settings in the repository unless
# you have a very specific need like some helpful settings for an entire team to use and then,
# you need to account for the same directory being generated and modified by team members.
# Almost everyone simply excludes all IDE settings files and directories in all cases.
.idea/


# Directory to briefly hold working files inside the project but not add them to git.
# * Tell your IDE to exclude/ignore this directory to reduce indexing & inspection overhead.
# In IntelliJ IDEs, this is called "Mark as Excluded".

# Build version file created at build+deploy time by auto script
# <OBFUSCATED-PATH> would be like a very low-security password concept where you have a directory on your
# site that is accessible to anyone, but is hidden by not being linked to and having a name that is difficult
# to see, remember, guess etc. Don't keep sensitive information in such an "obfuscated" directory.
# I use it to keep a list of links to protoype pages/sections of a site.
# It's also where I output the build a global build identifier so I can easily veryfy the build identity of an
# running instance. You need to be able to do that. But there is no need for fuch a file to be easily accessible,
# but simply obfuscating the path seems like the right thing to do. Then you have the option to do some other
# things inside such a directory. Maybe this is where you would put the initial login portal for some administrative
# functions that your dont want handled by your main public application login portal.
# Here are some ideas: 1l1lO0O0, 0o1l0ol, O0O0, 11ll11ll
# Patterns like this work to keep the directory open and accessible, but not easily glimpsed and remembered
# or guessed, which is a nice way to keep it as a semi-private, yet convenient, accessible directory/path.

# Below are the remnants of the .gitignore file created by create-react-app and installed inside the web app directory
# (/nucleus/) but I only want one .gitignore file at the moment, so the following entries are being analyzed and
# then cleanly consolidated into this existing .gitignore file. About half of those entries have been addressed.

# Also, generally this file could use a lot of
# cleanup. It is a very important file in this project and most of thie .gitignore file is from the one which
# GitHub gives you for Node and it has a lot of things in it we do not need.
# TODO: Clean up and fully organize this project root .gitignore

# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.
