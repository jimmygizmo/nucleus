Nucleus /datavolume/ directory
============================

This /datavolume/ directory is here as a placeholder and will be used to store any kind of data for persistence
and isolation from the application itself as well as for data to be shared across containers.

This about file (/datavolume/about-datavolume.txt) is present so git will store this placeholder directory
because git will not store an empty directory. It is good to have such a directory in place in the
project repository for clarity, simplicity of setup, code simplicity and other benefits.

PLEASE NOTE:
The .gitignore file in the root of this project has important entries in place so that this about file
and the directory itself are stored in the repository,
but nothing else inside the directory will be added to git.

This /datavolume/ directory is intended to only hold temporary runtime data, specifically general purpose data
of the local running instance, whether it is your development instance on your laptop
or your cloud VM instance, where you will mount this directory to some kind of backed-up, persistent volume,
so that if your VM goes away or in whatever scenario, your general application runtime/instance data and
cross-container-shared data will remain in place and in good condition.

The /dbvolume/ directory is very similar, but is for your critical MongoDB database data files, which need
the same kind of local instance filesystem persistence in the current standalone Nucleus architecture.
