# about-react-aside.txt

This directory contains files generated by create-react-app which we will not be using
or which we may use at a later time, but for now would only clutter our app.

When the app is fully mature, anything left in this directory will likely be deleted.

Other things can go here if they are items that will be used for development of the React
app soon but are not needed inside the app at this moment.

Items from the React web application which are being temporarily disabled for whatever reason can go here.
