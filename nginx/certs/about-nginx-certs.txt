# /nginx/certs/about-nginx-certs.txt

This directory remains in the repo and remains empty until copy commands (kept in /auto/ dir)
copy the SSL/TLS certificate, key and dhparam.pem files into this directory prior to building the docker container.
Those files will come from the /secrets/ directory.
This about-nginx-certs.txt file keeps the /nginx/certs/ directory in the repo. Git does not hold empty dirs.
The .gitignore file will ignore everything inside the /nginx/certs/ directory except for a few about files
and an included nucleus_dhparam.pem to get you started until you make your own dhparam.pem file.

The main reason for this arrangement is to keep the SSL/TLS files together with a variety of other secrets and
keep those at the top-level of the project in the /secrets/ directory where it is easier to put them in place through
a secure process which is separate from the git repo.

Remain well aware of these and always make sure they are excluded from the repo. Maintain secrets as a priority
at the most visible and accessible level of a project.
This /nginx/certs/ directory has all other contents excluded from the repository except for the 3 files noted above.
