Nucleus /dbvolume/ directory
============================

This /dbvolume/ directory is here as a placeholder and will be used to store MongoDB data for persistence
and isolation from the application itself.

This about file (/dbvolume/about-dbvolume.txt) is present so git will store this placeholder directory
because git will not store an empty directory. It is good to have such a directory in place in the
project repository for clarity, simplicity of setup, code simplicity and other benefits.

PLEASE NOTE:
The .gitignore file in the root of this project has important entries in place so that this about file
and the directory itself are stored in the repository,
but nothing else inside the directory will be added to git.

This /dbvolume/ directory is intended to only hold runtime data, specifically the MongoDB
database data files of the local running instance, whether it is your development instance on your laptop
or your cloud VM instance, where you will mount this directory to some kind of backed-up, persistent volume,
so that if your VM goes away or in whatever scenario, your database and all your application data,
will remain in place and in good condition. This kind of local instance filesystem persistence in the
current standalone Nucleus architecture is a key feature.

The /dbvolume/ directory is very similar, but is for your critical MongoDB database data files, which need
the same kind of local instance filesystem persistence in the current standalone Nucleus architecture.

The /datavolume/ directory is very similar, but is for general data sharing across containers as well as
the same kind of local persistence.
