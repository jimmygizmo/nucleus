Nucleus Stack - MongoDB initial creation of logical database, admin user, admin password

For mongosh info see: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/
TODO: Add link to docker/docker-compose exec shell info

--------
1. Bring the stack up. MongoDb should stay up but Apollo will fail to come up because the user and db it will
attempt to use do not exist yet. While docker compose still has the MongoDB "nucleus-mongo" container running,
get the ID of the container by doing a docker-compose ps. Copy the ID of the running mongo container to use
in the following steps.
docker ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE          COMMAND            CREATED      STATUS         PORTS                      NAMES
98cda0c7f5df  nucleus-mongo  "docker-entry..."  3 hours ago  Up 49 seconds  0.0.0.0:44017->27017/tcp   nucleus-mongo
* Copy the CONTAINER ID. In the example above it is: 98cda0c7f5df

Apollo and NGINX might not stay up until we so a few steps
with the DB. These are some of the only manual setup/config steps we need to make and it only needs to be done
the first time a database is instantiated. Your database data files stay persisted across runs inside
the /datavolume directory. But to get started we need to create the logical database, a user and a password.


--------
2. Use docker-compose (or plain docker if necessary) to get a bash shell inside the running mongo container.
This assumes you have the stack or at least the mongo container running:
docker-compose exec -it <CONTAINER-ID-FROM-ABOVE> bash
* If this does not work, and you get a warning that the container is not running,
  try just doing "docker" instead of "docker-compose" in the command:
docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID-FROM-ABOVE> bash

(The situation with docker-compose vs. "docker compose" vs. just "docker" is a little transitional at the moment,
 since Docker Compose has become a docker plugin and is transitioning from being a standalone tool.
 I'm not sure why the command behavior was a little inconsistent for me recently, but it must be because of this.)


--------
3. Once in bash, launch the "mongosh" client which is available now in the mongo container:
mongosh


--------
4. "Use" what will be the new logical database. Initially your prompt will indicate the 'test' default db:

test> use nucleusdb
switched to db nucleusdb
nucleusdb>

We have not yet created anything yet though. We need to make a user for this new logical database to stick around.


--------
5. Create the admin user.

** Yes we are storing these credentials here in the repository. These credentials
only get used inside the docker compose internet network and the MongoDB port is never mapped outside of that
network so this is not a security concern and can probably remain like this in most applications. Higher security
is only needed in the communications that move outside of the cloud VPC and onto the Internet. These credentials
are fine to store in the repository and even to transmit in the clear within the DOcker Compose network, between
containers.

Create the user and password, thus making the new logical database "nucleusdb" persist beyond the current session.
Of course, you are free to change these, but you will need to change them in the Apollo configuration or
general stack configuration as well.

nucleusdb> db.createUser(
... {  user: "nucleusdbuser",
...     pwd: "nucleusdbpass",
... 	roles:[{role: "userAdminAnyDatabase" , db:"admin"}]
... })
{ ok: 1 }

** Here is the command, so you can easily copy it:
db.createUser({user: "nucleusdbuser", pwd: "nucleusdbpass", roles:[{role: "userAdminAnyDatabase" , db:"admin"}]})

Success is indicated by:
{ ok: 1 }


--------
6. Show the new user to verify:

nucleusdb> show users
[
  {
    _id: 'nucleusdb.nucleusdbuser',
    userId: new UUID("8ab92d2e-5ede-42f8-923d-16cd26f3a0c1"),
    user: 'nucleusdbuser',
    db: 'nucleusdb',
    roles: [ { role: 'userAdminAnyDatabase', db: 'admin' } ],
    mechanisms: [ 'SCRAM-SHA-1', 'SCRAM-SHA-256' ]
  }
]
nucleusdb>

* The logical database should now persist because you created something on it (the admin user).

Because we are mapping the MongoDB data directory (/data/db inside the container) to a local directory
of /dbvolume or a VM directory of /data/datavolume, our new logical database and our new user and any other
data we create, will be preserved across all stops and starts of the stack.

--------

* NOTE: Now Apollo will be able to start up and connect to this new database. What it will do immediately upon
first connecting is it will create all the collections needed for your test/mock data, and it will populate those
collections.

** NOTE ALSO: Every time Apollo starts, it checks for the existence of the test/mock collections and if any which
are missing are re-created. If you delete one, it will be back the next time Apollo starts, which is a really nice
feature for data like this. This is one of the features that makes The Nucleus Stack so friendly to developers.

TODO: Apollo currently only checks for the existence of mock collections. Make it also check for the document
count to match a known value and if it does not, re-create that entire mock collection. This is a simple step which
reinforces the use of the mock/test data for more rigorous testing and helps that data serve its purpose in other
contexts or even so you can be more sure of giving good demos using that mock data.
