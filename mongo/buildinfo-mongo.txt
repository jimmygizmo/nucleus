This "buildinfo" file is simply copied into the container.
Later this file will contain a build ID so each container has this ID within it.
* Take care that this is done in the last layer so it does not unintentionally invalidate
  any cached layers, because this will change on every build.
* Generating the build ID and copying into the file and into this build must be done as the
  last command in the Dockerfile. (or as close to the last as possible.)

TODO: Confirm this theory and the info in this doc. Add the step to create the ID in this file.
