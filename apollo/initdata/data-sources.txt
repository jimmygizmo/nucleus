The Nucleus Stack - Mock/Test Data from Kaggle, Government Agencies and Educational Institutions

---- DATA SOURCES - GOOD ONES
I try to use the best data I can find for mock/test purposes, and then I treat it in a best-practice manner.
Most data sources I consider have already been cleaned and well formatted and are highly rated by the community
or somewhat well known, so in most cases I do not need to clean data.

---- TO CLEAN OR NOT TO CLEAN AND HOW
In the more rare cases where I need to clean data I may remove obviously partial data. I will reformat any data
for processing and presentation reasons, but I will never remove or alter the "information" in that data or
change its nature relative to the original data set in any way. This is the standard/methodology I have set
for how I use data in this project. You can define data treatment any way you like, but it is helpful to use
"good" data sources and "treat" the data properly and define and document your data sources and all processing
you do to your data. You will get better results and you and your apps and data will have more credibility
and perform better overall.

---- OUTLIERS - ISOLATE BUT KEEP THEM
In datasets which are a little less clean, there may be "outliers". Outliers are records/docs that have data points
that don't make a lot of rational sense in the context in which you are interpreting, rendering, charting
or using that data in some way. It could be a crazy spike on a graph that everyone realizes would be impossible
in reality. It could be a point in a point cloud that is so far out by itself that it needs to be considered
as either some other phenomenon to be analyzed separately or just bad/corrupt data or some bad processing
artifact or by-product. You have to use your human intelligence about these things. It is usually obvious where
you need to remove outliers, HOWEVER, always realize this: In some datasets, under some conditions, your
OUTLIERS are really the most important aspect of your dataset in some important context, even the one you
have in front of you. So you can clean outliers for specific well-understood interpretational contexts, but
don't just toss them in the trash. You might be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Set your outliers
aside and keep the appropriate notes with them about your criteria for isolating them. This also keeps a
record of how you have altered the overall context and shape of the dataset. It is often ok to alter things in
this way, but don't do it without documenting it and even in some cases, I think it is wise to keep those
outlier records/datum around or at least their IDs which can help reconstruct altered data, so you thereby
retain a "known" condition of all of your data and its full history.

DATA SOURCES USED IN NUCLEUS

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Light-Duty Vehicles Produced in the United States 1975 - 2019

FILE:
/apollo/initdata/dataVehicleTypesByYears.js

https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10314
Trend in numbers and types.
In 2009 overall production was severely impacted by the economic recession.
In 2017 SUVs exceeded cars for the first time and has since.
103 records.

TREATMENT: Data was reformatted but not cleaned or altered as it comes from this source in good condition.

Electric Vehicles Available for Sale New, Eastern Europe (Poland), 2020.

This dataset contains a lot of vehicles available in the US and worldwide, so I think it works fine as a set of
nearly all electric vehicles available for purchase new in 2020. If I can find a good US dataset like this I will
add that as a separate collection. I am on the lookout for a respectable/known worldwide dataset for EVs as well.
The current dataset seems to have some good performance and feature information, and I am thinking of charting
the acceleration against other factors like price, efficiency and range. This could be an interesting view of
this data. Perhaps some point cloud charts might also be interesting for this data.

TODO: Complete the source information here.

TREATMENT: Data was reformatted but not cleaned or altered as it comes from this source in good condition.
