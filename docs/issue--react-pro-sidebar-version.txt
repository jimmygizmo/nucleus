R&D Nucleus uses an older react-pro-sidebar, and it is needed to get on the current version, but there have
been a lot of changes and with our light/dark feature it will take a little adaptation.

About 60% of the web application is in place and ready to run, so I will be committing to the repo with the
nearly running web app and while I had upgraded the sidebar, I am going to put that back to a lower version
before I commit the app and just get things working as in the R&D Nucleus version.

On a related note, the sidebar may have been "forced" back previously and this might have been the source of
dependency conflicts (peer conflicts) that I have mentioned in some comments and which may be resolved when
we just get the sidebar upgrade. This will need to be a small side project done soon.
