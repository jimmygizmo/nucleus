# TODO: Must abstract the Docker Image Name which has the full REPO URL -OUT- of the code somehow or
#   use a system of comments to make the needed steps clear. The issue is that we don't want to store a
#   full repo URL with its sensitive IDs in it inside our code repo for the stack, but we do need to refer
#   to image names that like to use those full URLs for cloud deployment at least in our production
#   docker-compose.production.yml file, but at least in our development docker-compose.yml file (this one)
#   we don't need those full URLs for image names, HOWEVER, here is the current sticking point: our
#   automation currently is set up to have those URL-laden image names hardcoded.
#   A solution is needed, otherwise this means a bit more manual configuration or that one of our automation
#   scripts will not work out of the box without configuration. It might be time for some template parsing
#   steps which will prepare things like our automation scripts and/or docker-compose.yml files, etc.
#   I'd like to use really basic tools for that but it will depend on how I want to execute such that
#   kind of a parsing, config-generation step, which we currently don't have.
