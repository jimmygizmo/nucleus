If you want an A+ SSL security rating on your site, one thing you will need is a dhparam.pem file.
Nucleus incudes one and is configured to use it.

A dhparam.pem is like a big and very random number which enables strong encryption. Ideally you will generate
your own following instructions in this project's notes, docs and/or comments or by searching online.
However it is OK to share dhparam.pem files or to get one generated on a website, etc.

I have generated one just for this project which everyone can use with no problem until they generate their own,
which is very simple. The nginx-nucleus.conf file is where it is referenced and used.

Usually we NEVER add secrets to the repo. Well, although nucleus_dhparam.pem lives in the /secrets/ directory
and is part of a set of files needed for strong SSL that gets an A+ rating, it is not really a secret like
other files are. For this reason, we have an entry in the .gitignore file which allows this shared/project
nucleus_dhparam.pem file to be kept in the repository.

When you get your own SSL certificate, you should generate your own dhparam.pem file for the best possible security.
Using a dhparam.pem file that another domain is using is really not an issue for practical seurity concerns.

The Nucleus Stack is designed to minimize all manual steps required to deploy and run the stack, so including this
is just another aspect of that goal. Generate your own when you have time. It is easy and theoretically will increase
your SSL security a little bit, for some extremely rare edge-case scenarios.
The point is to use one, even if it is shared with other domains. It is just a big random number.
