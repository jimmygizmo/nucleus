Admin dashboard & data visualization variant of the Nucleus Stack by Jim Mannix.

React full stack web application with data layers. Complete, automated, premium React site infrastructure and admin dashboard application featuring data visualization. Docker, MongoDB, Apollo, GraphQL, React Router, NGINX, Material UI, Nivo Charts, much more.

Nucleus Stack is intended to help you stand up a cutting-edge site or application with all the best technology in a complete full-stack, containerized and automated and ready to run anywhere. Nucleus is also a valuable FUll Stack learning tool, current for 2023.

The frontend is React with React Router, styled with Material UI with best-practice theming and light/dark modes hooked into every component and element. Data visualization is driven by the GraphQL data layers and comes from Nivo Charts and D3.js. FullCalendar is also integrated.

The custom GraphQL client is based on simple fetch and React and features a loading state and multiple friendly error modes. The Object Data Model (ODM) layer, MongoDB drivers and powerful schema and model features are provided by Mongoose.

The backend is graphql/document oriented (NoSQL) with MongDB as the data store and Apollo as the GraphQL server.

Custom data-initialization uses good quality test/mock data sourced from Kaggle, Government and Educational sources. Apollo initialiation always makes sure mock/test data is present so Nucleas stack always comes up, even out of the box.

What's more, the data volume is external to the container stack, so it can be backed up on your affordable persistent cloud volumes or local to your dev machine, so you never lose data, regardless of what happens to the stack, no matter where it is deployed.
